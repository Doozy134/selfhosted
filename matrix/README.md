# Matrix Server

### Self host a matrix server with Docker

Note this is the 'service' worker and is what handles the communication on the matrix project. Therefore you will need to use a matrix client to interact with this server.

e.g. element.io

which you can use on any browser or can additionally spin up a docker image for as well.
